## SOLID Principles

The project adheres to the SOLID principles to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase:

-   **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each module and class has a single responsibility.
-   **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: The code is open for extension but closed for modification.
-   **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes can be substituted for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
-   **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use.
-   **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but rather both should depend on abstractions.
