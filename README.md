# Rentalx Node.js Project

## Overview

Rentalx is a Backend Node.js project designed for educational purposes to help users manage their car rental needs. This project serves as an example implementation of the SOLID principles, providing a foundation for understanding and practicing these principles in real-world scenarios.

## Features

-   **User Registration and Authentication**: Securely manage user accounts and ensure data privacy.
-   **Car Inventory**: Keep track of available cars, their specifications, and rental details.
-   **Booking System**: Allow users to easily book and manage their car rentals.
-   **Billing and Invoicing**: Implement a billing system for rental transactions.
-   **Feedback and Rating**: Enable users to provide feedback and ratings for rented cars.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Rentalx.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd Rentalx
    yarn
    ```

3. Start the application:

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3333`.

## Configuration

-   Customize the application settings in the `config` directory.
-   Configure authentication strategies in `config/passport.js`.

## Usage

1. Register for an account on the application.
2. Explore the available car inventory.
3. Book a car for your desired rental period.
4. Receive invoices for your transactions.
5. Provide feedback and ratings for the rented cars.

## SOLID Principles

RentalX is designed following the SOLID principles to demonstrate good software design practices:

-   **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each module and class has a single responsibility.
-   **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: The code is open for extension but closed for modification.
-   **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes can be substituted for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
-   **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use.
-   **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but rather both should depend on abstractions.
